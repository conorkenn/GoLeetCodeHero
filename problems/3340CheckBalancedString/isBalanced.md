## 3340. Check Balanced String

You are given a string `num` consisting of only digits. A string of digits is called balanced if the sum of the digits at even indices is equal to the sum of digits at odd indices.

Return `true` if `num` is balanced, otherwise return `false`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: num = "1234"
Output: false

Explanation:
- The sum of digits at even indices is 1 + 3 == 4, and the sum of digits at odd indices is 2 + 4 == 6.
- Since 4 is not equal to 6, num is not balanced.
```
### Example 2:
```
Input: num = "24123"
Output: true

Explanation:
- The sum of digits at even indices is `2 + 1 + 3 == 6`, and the sum of digits at odd indices is `4 + 2 == 6`.
- Since both are equal the `num` is balanced.
```


##
### Constraints:

- `2 <= num.length <= 100`
- `num` consists of digits only


## Answer
```
func isBalanced(num string) bool {
    evenSum := 0
    oddSum := 0

    for i := 0; i < len(num); i++ {
        if i % 2 == 0{
            evenSum += int(num[i] - '0')
        } else {
            oddSum += int(num[i] - '0')
        }
    }
    return evenSum == oddSum
}
```
